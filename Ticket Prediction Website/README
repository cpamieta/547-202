This folder contains a basic website that I built to be used as the UI for users to check if there auction would sell or
not depending on the parameters they send. The four main parts of the site are the index.html , ticket.php, test.py and the saved
trained machine learning models.

1)index.html is just the frontend website the user would see. I used bootstrap as the style framework of the site. The main function of this
site is a form that the user would fill out with the ticket information. This data would be sent to the ticket.php file.

2)ticket.php, the function of this file is to get the user data from the htms site and send that info to the test.py script

3)test.py, this file sends the user data into the trained models to predict if the ticket would sell or not. At the end, it would 
send the results back to the ticket.php file which would then display the results on the frontend webpage to the user.

4)saved models, did not upload to github since they where to large. I used pickle library to save and load the models.
